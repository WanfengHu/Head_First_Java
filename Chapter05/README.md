# Notes for Chapter 5

* Java program should start with a high-level design.

* Three things to write when creating a new class:
    * prepcode (pseudocode) --> what to do (logic of the program)
    * testcode
    * real (Java) code

* `Integer.parseInt()`: convert String representing a digit ("0","1", etc) to an integer.
