# Notes for Chapter 2

* class = instance variables + methods
    * instance variables: things the object knows (state/data)
    * methods:things the object does (behavior)

* class != object  
It's a blueprint for an object.

* Create object from class `new`.
```
    Dog d = new Dog();
```

* The two uses of **main**:
    * to **test** the real class
    * to **launch/start** the Java application

* 'Global' methode/variable: `public static`
    - `final`: constant

* Java Archive: a `.jar` file based on the pkzip format
