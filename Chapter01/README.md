# Notes for Chapter 1

* The way Java works:  
source -> compiler (javac) -> bytecode -> JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

* Code structure:  
source file -> class -> methods
    * At least 1 **class** in a program
    * At least 1 `main()` method in a program

* Syntax:
    * Each statement must end in a semicolon `;`.
    * A single line comment begins with two forward slashes `//`.
    * Variables are declared with a name and a type (Java is a strongly-typed language)

* Put boolean test inside parentheses.
``` 
    while (x == 4) { } 
```

* A boolean and an integer are not compatible types in Java.
